# Stroll

*Stroll* is mobile application prototype I created with my team in HCDE 518. Stroll allows you to safely explore and discover points of interest in your neighborhood and uploading your own content and experiences to share with others in your community.

**Role: Product / Visual / UX Designer
Time: Sept 2020 - Dec 2020**

My team worked remotely during the Autumn 2020 quarter. We were tasked to create a product that focuses on your wellbeing and health during the COVID-19 pandemic. For this project, I worked on the overall product, experience, and visual design, research, programming (building the teams custom [website](https://strolluw.github.io/StrollApp/), and prototyping.

The **challenge** my team took on was the restricted mobility and travel during the pandemic and our limited ability to explore new places. The **question** we were determined to answer was: How can we utilize technology to promote neighborhood exploration and encourage physical activity while building a bridge for community connection during quarantine?

## Our Process

*“TRAVEL” WITHOUT LEAVING YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD AND DISCOVER NEW WAYS TO CONNECT WITH THE PEOPLE AND PLACES YOU LOVE.*

## Research

Our research covered three methodologies including ***Diary Studies, Surveys, and Competitive Analysis.*** 

For our **Diary Study**, we invited 18 participants to walk around their neighborhood and share 5 pictures of interesting things they encountered and to explain why each picture caught their eye. We wanted to use this information to determine if our participants were, indeed, curious about things in their neighborhood, as well as documenting the types of landmarks or points of interest to identify themes.

After the Diary Study, participants completed a **Survey** to further elaborate upon their experience. From the participants, we found that, during the pandemic, they feel ***getting outside for a walk is beneficial to their mental health*** and ***they explored their own neighborhood weekly***, and they believe ***connecting with the local community is important.***

// DATA NUMBERS VISUAL //

Our last research method was **Competitive Analysis**. For this, I researched apps that either most resembeled the type of functionality (navigation, maps, mixed reality) and content (reviews, user generated content, landmarks, hashtags) we wanted to include in Stroll.

The primary applications we investigated were Google Maps, Like a Local, and World Brush.

## Personas

After reviewing our research, we created multiple primary and secondary user personas to highlight the key behaviors we anticipated for our users. Based on our researchers, we created a persona, **Wanda Wanderer** to be our primary since all of our participants enjoyed wandering their neighborhoods and discovering new points of interest.

## Design Ideation

Our synthesized design vision determined that Stroll needed to should foster a **sense of belonging** by helping people feel more connected to their community, should encourage users to **get outside** in support of physical and mental wellness, and help users who are passionate about their community **easily create and share content** with other users.

### Mid-fidelity Design and Journey Map

This is an example of one of my mid-fidelity prototype/user flows. This flow focuses on our "Creator" pathway, in which a user is uploading their own content to a "Pin" or point of interest users can interact with to explore and learn more about their neighborhood.

### Feedback and Iterations

#### 1. ON-SCREEN, LIVE MAP
Users loved the combination of an Augmented Reality (AR), real-time view. However, users thought the location marker looked like a video ‘play’ button, and once you click into a pin they were unsure what to do next. Also, they were unsure why the pin was called space needle when it wasn’t directly on it.

// ITERATION 1 IMAGE //

**Changes: Adjusted location marker, made CTA language more clear, and added elements to display the pin is user-generated**

#### 2. PIN PROFILE PAGE
Once you get close to the pin, users were confused and one commented that the UI for our arrival screen looked like an ad.

// ITERATION 2 IMAGE //

**Changes: Changed the location marker to reflect the pin itself, to maintain consistence. We also changed the layout of the expanded pin to compliment the ‘Start Walking’ screen.**

#### 3. USER ONBOARDING
Users felt like they were unclear about the app's capabilities when they arrived to the home screen. So we needed to make our onboarding very clear so the user knows functions like navigating to "Pins" and how they can share their own content.

// ITERATION 3 IMAGE //

**Changes: Redesigned the onboarding experience to include more action oriented language to descibe the app’s core functions. The new design also switched from tapping ‘Next’ to navigate to the proceeding screen to a drag motion.**

## Final Product

### Final Design Rationale

When we originally brainstormed our app concept, we wanted to focus on mixed-reality and immersive experiences, however, we quickly discovered that users were simply excited about exploring their neighborhood and learning about their community as if they were a tourist. Kind of like travelling to a new city and having a local show you around. Thus, our final rationale was to create the joy of a fresh adventure and ‘travel’ without users needing to leave their neighborhood. Morevoer, users wanted to discover and share personal experience with the community to hope others get as much excitement as they did when discovering it.

***Future Iterations:*** There is no doubt that we would love to take Stroll a step further by including mixed-reality to create a more immersive experience when exploring your neighborhood, as well as gamify the app by including features like scavanger hunts and Where's Waldo-type games.
