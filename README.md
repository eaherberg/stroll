# Stroll

*Stroll* is mobile application prototype I created with my team in HCDE 518. Stroll allows you to safely explore and discover points of interest in your neighborhood and uploading your own content and experiences to share with others in your community.

**Role: Product / Visual / UX Designer

My team worked remotely during the Autumn 2020 quarter. We were tasked to create a product that focuses on your wellbeing and health during the COVID-19 pandemic. For this project, I worked on the overall product, experience, and visual design, research, programming (building the teams custom [website](https://strolluw.github.io/StrollApp/), and prototyping.

The **challenge** my team took on was the restricted mobility and travel during the pandemic and our limited ability to explore new places. The **question** we were determined to answer was: How can we utilize technology to promote neighborhood exploration and encourage physical activity while building a bridge for community connection during quarantine?

## Our Process

*“TRAVEL” WITHOUT LEAVING YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD AND DISCOVER NEW WAYS TO CONNECT WITH THE PEOPLE AND PLACES YOU LOVE.*

## Research

Our research covered three methodologies including ***Diary Studies, Surveys, and Competitive Analysis.*** 

For our **Diary Study**, we invited 18 participants to walk around their neighborhood and share 5 pictures of interesting things they encountered and to explain why each picture caught their eye. We wanted to use this information to determine if our participants were, indeed, curious about things in their neighborhood, as well as documenting the types of landmarks or points of interest to identify themes.

After the Diary Study, participants completed a **Survey** to further elaborate upon their experience. From the participants, we found that, during the pandemic, they feel ***getting outside for a walk is beneficial to their mental health*** and ***they explored their own neighborhood weekly***, and they believe ***connecting with the local community is important.***

Our last research method was **Competitive Analysis**. For this, I researched apps that either most resembeled the type of functionality (navigation, maps, mixed reality) and content (reviews, user generated content, landmarks, hashtags) we wanted to include in Stroll.

The primary applications we investigated were Google Maps, Like a Local, and World Brush.

## Personas

After reviewing our research, we created multiple primary and secondary user personas to highlight the key behaviors we anticipated for our users. Based on our researchers, we created a persona, **Wanda Wanderer** to be our primary since all of our participants enjoyed wandering their neighborhoods and discovering new points of interest.
