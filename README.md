My team worked remotely during the Autumn 2020 quarter. We were tasked to create a product that focuses on your wellbeing and health during the COVID-19 pandemic. For this project, I worked on the overall product, experience, and visual design, research, programming (building the teams custom [website](https://strolluw.github.io/StrollApp/), and prototyping.

The challenge my team took on was the restricted mobility and travel during the pandemic and our limited ability to explore new places. The question we were determined to answer was: How can we utilize technology to promote neighborhood exploration and encourage physical activity while building a bridge for community connection during quarantine?
